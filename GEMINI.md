## Project Overview

This project is a self-contained HTML file, `index.html`, designed as an interactive tutorial or test for learning Python programming, specifically with the `turtle` graphics library. The Python code is executed directly in the browser using the Skulpt library.

The `index.html` file includes several levels of exercises, starting from basic input/output to more complex tasks involving loops, functions, and graphics with the `turtle` module.

The project also contains a GitHub Actions workflow file (`.github/workflows/jekyll-docker.yml`) that suggests a Jekyll-based static site generation setup using Docker. However, the main `index.html` file does not appear to be part of a Jekyll project structure.

## Building and Running

To run this project, simply open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser. No special build steps or server is required.

The Python code snippets within the file can be executed by clicking the "Run" button associated with each exercise.

## Development Conventions

The project does not have any explicit development conventions. The Python code is embedded within the HTML file and is intended to be edited directly within the `<textarea>` elements.
